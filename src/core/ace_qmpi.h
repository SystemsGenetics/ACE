    * sending and receiving of data by using Qt slots and signals to allow for
    * event handling through Qt's event handling system. This is a singleton class
    * which only has a single instance you can access through a special static
    * function. This singleton class is however special in it has to be shutdown
    * before exiting the program and cannot be initialized more than once. This
    * requirement is due to how MPI works.
    *
    * Listening for incoming MPI messages can also be enabled or disabled, and is
    * disabled by default.
