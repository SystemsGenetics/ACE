/*!
 * This is the console application instantiated and executed by a program using
 * ACE. This class initializes the ACE system with the given application
 * information and factories, along with parsing the command line and
 * determining which command the user has given. If the command given is a dump
 * or inject command this class handles those commands itself, otherwise the
 * command is passed on to another class for specialized processing. This class
 * continues execution until ACE and the program using it has completed and is
 * exiting. There should only be one instance of this class for the entire
 * program, most commonly instantiated within the main function. If multiple
 * instances of this class exist the behavior of the program is undefined.
